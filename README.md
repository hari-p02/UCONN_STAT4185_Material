# UCONN_STAT4185_Material_NumPy_Requests_BeautifulSoup_Pandas_MLModels

Hello! This repository contains the material I made for the first few week of the STAT 4185 Special Topics - Advanced Data Manipulation & Analysis with Python here at the University of Connecticut.

The first few weeks are as follows:

 - Week 3 - `Numpy`
 - Week 4 - Web Scraping (Requests and BeautifulSoup)
 - Week 5 - Pandas
 - Week 7 - Machine Learning Model Intuition

The material for these can be found below :)

## Week 3: `Numpy`

The `NumPy` package is incredibly powerful for scientific computation, to learn more about the package watch the following pre-recorded videos (NOTE this is an unlisted link).

### Playlist

The note book I am using for this video can be found in the `numpy` folder here [`/numpy/Numpy_videos.ipynb`](https://github.com/hari-p02/UCONN_STAT4185_Material_NumPy_Requests_BeautifulSoup_Pandas_MLModels/blob/main/numpy/Numpy_videos.ipynb).

### In-Class

For the in class material I made a `NumPy` "Jeopardy" game. It is in quotations because this is a coding base game. The link to access the game can be accesses [here](https://jeopardylabs.com/play/2022-08-05-196).

#### How to play the `NumPy` Jeopardy Game

To play the jeopardy game make sure to download the starter code here - [`/numpy/NumpyJeopardy_StarterCode.ipynb`](https://github.com/hari-p02/UCONN_STAT4185_Material_NumPy_Requests_BeautifulSoup_Pandas_MLModels/blob/main/numpy/NumpyJeopardy_StarterCode.ipynb)

The starter code is structured in section based on the points (`100`, `200`, `300`, `400`) and within each of these section has the respective questions for each section (`Open Ended`, `Indexing/Slicing`, `Array Manipulation`, `Math`, `Miscellaneous`).

The answers for the jeopardy starter code here - [`/numpy/NumpyJeo_StarterCode_Answers.ipynb`](https://github.com/hari-p02/UCONN_STAT4185_Material_NumPy_Requests_BeautifulSoup_Pandas_MLModels/blob/main/numpy/NumpyJeo_StarterCode_Answers.ipynb)


### Homework

The homework assignment is a simple three question `.ipynb` files that covers some of the core `NumPy` concepts covered in the videos. The homework can be found here: [`/numpy/STAT4185_Numpy_Hw.ipynb`](https://github.com/hari-p02/UCONN_STAT4185_Material_NumPy_Requests_BeautifulSoup_Pandas_MLModels/blob/main/numpy/STAT4185_Numpy_Hw.ipynb)
